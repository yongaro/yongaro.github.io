# **Mandelbrot**

A small OpenGL university project allowing to visualize the Mandelbrot and Julia fractals.  
The Buddhabrot variant is also implemented with several interactions as well.  

* The only dependency is [**freeglut**](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) used for the windowing system.
* Several coloration mode are available for each fractal.
* The computation precision (or iteration count) can be modified.
* A keyboard navigation allows to move around and zoom.
* A mouse zoom using a rectangle selection.
