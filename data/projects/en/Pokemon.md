# [**Pokemon libGDX** <img src="./data/images/link-icon-2.png" width="25"/>](https://github.com/yongaro/Pokemon/tree/master/Pokemon-core)

A java Pokemon game engine developped using [**libGDX**](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), a cross-platform game creation framework.  

This project is fairly complete and implements several features of the game franchise :

* Animated maps created with the [**Tiled**](https://www.mapeditor.org/) editor.
* A new take on the game UI.
* Animated characters and Pokemons.
* NPC system able to handle dialogs, trainer battles and animations.
* A combat system using the stats, types and most mechanics of the 6th generation (X/Y).

The project is handled by [**Gradle**](https://gradle.org/) allowing to build it for the versions of Android, Linux, Mac or Windows.
