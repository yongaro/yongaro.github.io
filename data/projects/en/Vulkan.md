A rendering engine written in C++ 11 using Vulkan 1.0 and several libraies :

* The windowing and input systems are handled with [GLFW3](https://www.glfw.org/).
* [Assimp](http://assimp.org/) allows to load all the 3D assets formats it supports.
* The phong illumination is implemented and can render all the material loaded with the assets except for PBR.
