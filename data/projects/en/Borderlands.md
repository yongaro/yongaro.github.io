## Introduction

The goal of this project was to learn the usage of advanced 3D data structures (meshes, materials, skeletal animations, ...) along with the Entity Component System paradigm in Unreal Engine 4.

As of now the version **4.23** of the engine is supported and the following features are implemented :
- Procedural assembly and animation of 3D assets (characters and guns).
  - Characters are obtained with a combination of a body and a head.
  - Weapons are obtained by combining 4 parts sets (accessory, body, barrel, handle) from different manufacturers (Bandit, Jakobs, Maliwan, Torgue, ...).
    The weapon given at the start of the demo can be "rerolled" using the **1** and **2** key, the fire animation can be triggered using the **left click** and the reload animation using **R**.

- A very basic finite state machine AI for an Hyperion bot that inflict damage and can be shot.

More information can be found in the report given with this repository (available in french only).
